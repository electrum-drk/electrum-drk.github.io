	<p>Electrum-DRK is an easy-to-use <a href="https://www.darkcoin.io">Darkcoin</a>
	client based on <a href="https://electrum.org">Electrum</a>.
	It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure,
	because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase
	that you can write on paper or learn by heart.
	There is no waiting time when you start the client,
	because it does not download the Darkcoin blockchain.</p>

	<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

	<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
	<dl>
	<dt id="android">Is there a version of Electrum-DRK for Android?</dt>
	<dd>Android is currently not supported.</dd>

	<dt id="seed">What is the Seed?</dt>
	<dd>Electrum-DRK uses a 128-bit random seed to generate your private keys.
	The seed can be represented as a 12-word mnemonic code.
	You do not need to perform regular backups, because your wallet can be
	recovered from the seed that you can memorize or write on paper.

	<dt id="gap-limit">What is the gap limit?</dt>
	<dd>The gap limit is the maximum number of consecutive unused addresses
	in your deterministic sequence of addresses.
	Electrum-DRK uses a gap limit to stop looking for addresses,
	it is set to 5 by default, so the client get all addresses
	until 5 unused addresses are found.</dd>

	<dt id="freeze-address">What does it mean to "freeze" an address?</dt>
	<dd>When you freeze an address, the funds in that address will not be
	used for sending Darkcoins.
	You cannot send Darkcoins if you don't have enough funds in non-frozen addresses.</dd>

	<dt id="old-address">What to do with my old Darkcoin addresses and wallet when switching to Electrum-DRK?</dt>
	<dd>The best way to switch to Electrum-DRK is to send all the Darkcoins
	you have on your old wallet to one of the addresses on your Electrum-DRK wallet.
	This way you'll have all your Darkcoins secured with your seed.
	You could import the private keys from your old client,
	but in that case you would have to backup those keys separately,
	as they won't become part of your Electrum-DRK seed.</dd>

	<dt id="wallet-file">Where is my wallet file located?</dt>
	<dd>A default wallet file called <kbd>default_wallet</kbd> is created
	under the <kbd>/wallets</kbd> folder when you first run the application.
	On Windows, this folder is located in
	<kbd>\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Local\Electrum-DRK</kbd>.
	On all other operating systems, it is located in <kbd>~/.electrum-drk</kbd>.</dd>
